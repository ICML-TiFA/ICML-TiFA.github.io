In addition, if some perturbations are added to images or texts, it may cause the performance of large multi-modal models to decline in various visual tasks. This requires us to study what impact different input perturbations or some attack methods on image text will have on multi-modal large models, especially on trustworthiness, and how to defend against these possible impacts.',

When input images or texts contain malicious content or are subtly altered through perturbations, MLLMs can generate harmful responses or suffer from degraded performance across various visual tasks. This vulnerability poses a critical challenge to the trustworthiness and safety of MLLMs, necessitating robust defense mechanisms.The primary objective of this challenge is to develop innovative strategies and techniques to protect MLLMs against adversarial attacks that exploit their multimodal capabilities.',

        job: "The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) reflects its increasing capability and integration into our daily lives, from basic automated tools to sophisticated, autonomous systems. Initially, AI systems were simple agents performing goal-directed actions without specific human commands. Over time, these evolved into Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, which not only execute complex tasks but also enhance decision-making through advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. The most advanced tier of AI development includes ethically aligned, trustworthy agents. These agents are designed to operate reliably within ethical and safety frameworks, illustrating both the benefits and the essential need to manage the risks associated with AI's integration into society. This tiered framework—from basic agents, through linguistically skilled LLMs, to ethically guided trustworthy agents—underscores the progression and potential of AI in enhancing human capabilities and addressing complex challenges.",
