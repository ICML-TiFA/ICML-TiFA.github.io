      <p>
        Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the capability to process images and perform visual
        question-and-answer tasks. However, when input images or texts contain malicious content or are subtly altered
        through perturbations, MLLMs can generate harmful responses or experience degraded performance across various
        visual tasks. This vulnerability represents a significant challenge to the trustworthiness and safety of MLLMs,
        underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms. The primary goal of this challenge is to devise innovative
        strategies and techniques to safeguard MLLMs against attacks that leverage their multimodal capabilities.

      <h1 class="text-center font-bold text-4xl">Dataset</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Different from track 1, in this track, we recommend the participants to utilize various benchmarks to evaluate
        the effectiveness of proposed defense methods. The recommended benchmarks include but not limited to following
        datasets:
        <p>-MM-SafetyBench</p>
        <p>-Ch3Ef dataset</p>
        <p>-Other existing benchmarks for MLLM defense methods.</p>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-center font-bold text-4xl">Task Description</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The primary goal of this challenge is to design a robust defense framework on a Multimodal Large Language Model
        (MLLM), Llava-1.5, such that the defense-enhanced MLLM obtains comparable capability with the baseline and
        better safety rate. Participants can design either fine-tuning-based methods or ad-hoc-based methods to mitigate
        the vulnerability of MLLM in safety aspects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-center font-bold text-4xl">Participation</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Note that to ensure both fine-tuning-based defending methods and the ad-hoc-based counterparts are feasible to
        be explored. In this challenge, we do not use an online judge system to measure the effectiveness of proposed
        methods. Instead, participants should submit both technical reports and demo videos. All submissions will be
        double-blind peer-reviewed and choose the best candidates as accepted workshop papers.

      <h1 class="text-center font-bold text-4xl">After Acceptance</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The accepted works should prepare: 1) the camera ready submission, 2) a well-prepared physical demo for
        illustration in the workshop.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-center font-bold text-4xl">Submission Guideline (Both Review and Camera Ready)</h1>
      <br />
      <p>Submissions should be made on OpenReview.</p>
      <p>
        Submissions should be anonymised papers up to 4 pages (appendices can be added to the main PDF); excluding
        references. Authors are required to include a "Social Impacts Statement" that highlights "potential broader
        impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences". You must format your
        submission using the ICML_LATEX_style_file. Reviews will be single-blind, with at least two reviewers assigned
        to each paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome various types of papers including scientific papers and position papers. Scientific papers must not
        have appeared at an archival venue before, however, non-scientific papers that have appeared in archival venues
        outside main machine learning venues are welcomed for submission.
      </p>
      <p>
        All accepted papers will be available on the workshop website, but no formal workshop proceedings will be
        published.

        <h2 class="font-bold">I. Introduction (Proposal Description and Motivation)</h2>
        <p>
          In the introduction section, the most significant thing is to clarify the motivation, the key pipeline, and
          the contribution of your proposed method. Besides, we recommend the authors to explain how your work could
          impact the research direction of the attacking Multi-modal LLMs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-bold">II. Related Works</h2>
        <p>
          In this section, the authors could review previous attempts regarding trustworthy foundation models (e.g.,
          attack, defense, monitoring, and governance). Then explain how your work is similar to or different from
          previous counterparts. Good research proposals often tie into existing work to gain widespread adoption while
          inspiring novel future research.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-bold">III. Technical Details</h2>
        <p>In this section, the authors should illustrate all the implementation details for your proposed method.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Summarize the baseline of your method.</li>
          <li>Present the details of your attack method solution.</li>
          <li>The implementation detail of your proposed method.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-bold">IV. Major Experimental Results</h2>
        <p>
          Summarize the major experimental results, and make comparison with baseline methods and other counterparts to
          show the effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>Sufficient ablation studies to analyze the proposed methods or constructed prompts/perturbations.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold">V. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
        <p>Conclude your work and highlight your main contribution.</p>
        <p>State the limitation and future direction.</p>
